# theta4j plug-in minimal Java example

This is a minimal plug-in example of using Shiro's 
[theta4j library](https://github.com/theta4j/theta-web-api) 
for the RICOH THETA.

It is intended for people that like to learn from the smallest possible
piece of Java code. In the spirit of a really small
"Hello, World" type of application, this example does not use the 
[RICOH THETA Plug-in SDK](https://github.com/ricohapi/theta-plugin-sdk).

If you start from a new empty activity, you need to adjust the 
gradle build files and the AndroidManifest.xml for permissions.

If you prefer Kotlin, Shiro has an [example](https://github.com/theta4j/theta-web-api/tree/master/plugin-example).
